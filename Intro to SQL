SQL is a structured query language.
Because SQL helps in working with structured data, like the data stored in tables.
With SQL we create databases i.e, tables and we can retrieve required info from tables and we can manipulate data 
present in tables.
In 1970 EF Codd developed Relational Model based on Relation algebra and Tupe Relational Calculus.
Later on IBM developed SQL on basis of theoritical knowledge of Relational Model developed by EF Codd.
***
SQL is Domain Specific language because we can work on only Structured data i.e, Relational Data.
SQL is declarative language because it only tells what to do and it ignores how to do.
But later on PLSQL came it is procedural sql and it how to do. But when it comes to SQL it is purely declarative language.
SQL commands are:
DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, CONSTRAINTS.
