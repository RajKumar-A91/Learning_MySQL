NESTED QUERIES are SQL queries which have an outer query and inner subquery.
The subquery is a query nested within another query such as 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

EX:
SELECT lastname, firstname     ------>OUTER QUERY
FROM employee
WHERE addressCode IN (SELECT addressCode       -------->INNER QUERY
                      FROM office
                      WHERE country='INDIA');
