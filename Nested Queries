NESTED QUERIES are SQL queries which have an outer query and inner subquery.
The subquery is a query nested within another query such as 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

EX:
SELECT lastname, firstname     ------>OUTER QUERY
FROM employee
WHERE addressCode IN (SELECT addressCode       -------->INNER QUERY
                      FROM office
                      WHERE country='INDIA');
                      
*A subquery in MySQL is a query, which is nested into another SQL query and embedded with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement along with the various operators. 
We can also nest the subquery with another subquery. A subquery is known as the inner query, and the query that contains subquery is known as the outer query.

*The inner query executed first gives the result to the outer query, and then the main/outer query will be performed.

*MySQL allows us to use subquery anywhere, but it must be closed within parenthesis.

Way of writing subquery:
SELECT column_list (s) FROM  table_name  
WHERE  column_name OPERATOR  
   (SELECT column_list (s)  FROM table_name [WHERE])
