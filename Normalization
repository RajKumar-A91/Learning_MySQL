Normalization ia a technique that organizes tables in scuh a way that
redundancy and dependency of data is reduced.
It is technique of data modelling.
there are basiclly mainly 4 types of normalization and they are:
1nf, 2nf, 3nf, Bcnf


**If all the tables are in 2nf then we need to go for 3nf bcnf 4nf.


**1NF: Each table cell should have a single value. So, basically all the
records must be unique.


**2NF: Database should be 1NF and should also have single column primaryKey.

Transitive Functional Dependency: If change non key column value 
then we need to change other non key cloumn value.
Ex: if we change name from Raj to Rani 
Then we need to salutation from Mr to Ms.


**3NF: The database should be in 2NF and must not have any transitive
functional dependencies.



**BCNF: I your database is in 3rd NormalForm, there would be some scenarios
where anomalies would be present, if you have more one candidate key. Then
BCNF comes into role, where you divide your tables furhter so that there
would be only one candidate key present.
